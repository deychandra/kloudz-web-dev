Kloudz Computing was founded with a simple mission: to bridge the gap between world-class engineering talent and companies that need it. We saw that many businesses struggled to find quality developers, while talented engineers in India lacked access to interesting global projects.

Over the years, we've evolved from a pure staff augmentation company to a full-service technology partner. Today, we offer both IT services (building products from scratch) and contract hiring (scaling teams with vetted talent).

Our approach is simple: treat every client's project as if it were our own, hire only the best engineers, and deliver with transparency and accountability.

OUR VALUES:
-----------

1. Client-First Approach
   Your success is our success. We align our goals with yours and work as an extension of your team.

2. Engineering Excellence
   We take pride in clean code, best practices, and building things that last.

3. People Matter
   We invest in our engineers' growth because great people build great products.

4. Global Mindset
